# TCCSEngine

## Introduction

TCCSEngine is a (work in progress) game engine that is (aspired to be) entirely text-based. It's completely built using C and ncurses.

## Building

### Dependencies

To build TCCSEngine, you'll need:
- gcc (13.2.1 or greater)
- CMake (3.27.4 or greater)
- ncurses library

Since ncurses is only available on Linux and OSX, you will need to use WSL2 or a Virtual Machine in order to build this project if you are on Windows.
