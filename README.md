# TCCSEngine

## Introduction

This is my personal passion project. Please expect me to fail miserably!

TCCSEngine is a graphics engine built using C and ncurses.

## Dependencies

To use TCCSEngine, you will need:

- ncurses.h (Linux/OSX)

## Usage

This repository already has an example project ready for you to try TCCSEngine. The engine is split into modules:

- TCCSMath (tccsmath.h) - handles mathematical objects like matrices
- TCCSGraphics (tccsgraphics.h) - handles graphical output and structures like scenes, screens, meshes and more
